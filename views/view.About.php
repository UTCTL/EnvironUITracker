 		<h1>Team Tactics</h1>

 		<h1>Agility and control</h1>
 		<p>
 			Leave defenders in the dust or control the ball like the world's best footballers. Players explode into action with improved balance, cuts and closer touches when in possession, giving greater responsiveness and personality to the game’s superstars. Experience brilliant control as you keep the ball in a sprint or when searching for an opening in those close-touch situations.

 			Ball physics are authentic. You’ll see better accuracy in the spin, curl and flight of the football as it moves realistically after each contact. In FIFA 15, the game evolves with astonishingly lifelike ball trajectories and spin while dribbling, passing, taking a touch, or blocking a shot.
